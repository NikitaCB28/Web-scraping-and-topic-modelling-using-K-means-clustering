# Web-scraping-and-topic-modelling-using-K-means-clustering
We will be scrapping through reviews of British Airways customer feedback. After extracting the data, our next step involves cleaning the gathered information. Subsequently, we aim to apply clustering techniques to analyze and categorize the reviews based on common topics or themes.
## Web Scraping :
If you navigate to this link - [https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways] you will see reviews related to British Airways and the Airline itself. Now, we can use Python and BeautifulSoup to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.
## Data Preprocessing :
During manual inspection of the dataframe (df), it can be observed that a “|” symbol is present in reviews with verified or not verified status. Therefore, we can leverage the “|” symbol as a marker to extract and strip away the status information from each comment.
## Lemmatization: To enhance the cleanliness of our data, we can take one final step by lemmatizing the reviews.

## TfidfVectorizer:
TfidfVectorizer is a method from scikit-learn used to convert a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features. The TF-IDF representation captures the importance of words in the reviews based on their frequency and inverse document frequency. The final result obtained after TfidfVectorizercan be used for further analysis, such as clustering or building machine learning models.
## K-means clustering:
Next, we use k-means clustering for topic modelling. Clusters generated by the algorithm represent topics or themes present in the dataset. Documents within a cluster are likely to share common keywords, making it intuitive to interpret the main subject of each cluster as a distinct topic within the reviews. Adjustments to the number of clusters or the number of top terms to display can be varied based on project requirements.
## 2D Scatter Plot of Data Points Using PCA:
The vectorized data is transformed into a two-dimensional space using the PCA components. The resulting scatter plot provides a visual representation of the clustering results in a two-dimensional space, making it easier to observe the separation and distribution of data points across different clusters. Each colour represents a different cluster, aiding in the interpretation of the clustering outcome.
## Conclusion:
In conclusion, while the provided code lays the foundation for classifying and visualizing clusters within a dataset, the true essence of the work begins in the subsequent stages. Fine-tuning details and delving deeper into the intricacies of each cluster are crucial steps in comprehending the nuanced topics encapsulated within the grouped data. The initial classification is a starting point, and the real analytical journey involves a meticulous exploration of the clusters to extract meaningful insights and a comprehensive understanding of the underlying themes.
